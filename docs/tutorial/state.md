# State Tab

The State tab provides a complete view of the internal game state, useful for debugging, understanding game mechanics, and developing AI agents.

!!! warning "WARNING ON STATE REPRESENTATION"
    The state page uses the `State` representation. The Capstone Project can be solved without using the **State Representation**, however the State Representation is included for a lower level access to the representation.

## Overview

The State tab displays the full game state as an expanded JSON structure. This includes all internal data that defines the current game situation.
